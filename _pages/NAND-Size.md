A valid NAND backup should be one of the following sizes in most situations.
{: .notice--primary}

Occasionally, you will get a backup with a different size than one of these listed. It is fine for a backup to be larger than expected, just ensure that it is never *smaller* than the sizes listed.
{: .notice--info}

Note that a *min size* NAND will always be the smallest possible size for the purpose of saving space, and may not match the size of other NAND backups from your device. This is fine, just make sure that it matches one of the sizes on this page.
{: .notice--info}

The brand name refers to the manufacturer of the NAND chip in your device, **not** your SD card.

**Your backup should match one of the sizes on this page; if it does not, you should delete it and make a new one!**
