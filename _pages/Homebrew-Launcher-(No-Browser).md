The Homebrew Launcher has many different entrypoints, or methods of launching. The most common is browserhax, but for devices that can't use it, this page has many alternative options.
{: .notice}

If you do not already own any of these games and do not have another 3DS that can access the Homebrew Launcher, the cheapest option is to buy a "Nintendo Selects" copy of [Ocarina of Time 3D](https://amzn.to/2fkaKdp) (ensure you get the correct cartridge for your region) and a [Powersaves](http://amzn.to/2fb3VY7) (compatible with all regions), then use oot3dhax from the chart below.

Note that if you are on 11.2.0 and have NFIRM downgraded, all 11.1.0 compatible exploits will also be compatible with your 11.2.0 NFIRM downgraded system.
