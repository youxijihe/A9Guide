If you started on 2.1.0 **on Old 3DS**, this guide is for you.
{: .notice--success}

If you downgraded to 2.1.0 **on Old 3DS or 2DS** but for some reason have **no functional NAND backups**, this guide is for you.
{: .notice--success}

Your device may not show your installed games after the ctrtransfer. This is due to the tickets being removed by the transfer, which is why you back them up. They will be restored at the end of the guide.

If you have already hacked your 3DS before and have a EmuNAND based CFW setup, this guide deals exclusively with SysNAND and you should follow all instructions from within or applying to SysNAND. Note that the terms EmuNAND and RedNAND refer to slightly different implementations of [the same concept](http://3dbrew.org/wiki/NAND_Redirection).

#### Instructions

##### Section I - Prep work

4. Copy the 9.2.0 ctrtransfer image `.bin` and `.bin.sha` from the ctrtransfer zip to the `/files9/` folder on your SD card
5. Copy `Decrypt9WIP.bin` to the `/luma/payloads/` folder on your SD card and rename `Decrypt9WIP.bin` to `x_Decrypt9WIP.bin`
6. Reinsert your SD card into your 3DS

##### Section II - Backup tickets

5. Open Decrypt9 from arm9loaderhax by holding (X) during boot
6. Go to "Ticket/Titlekey Options", then select "Ticket Dump (SysNAND)"
7. Press (Select) to eject your SD card, then put it in your computer
8. Delete all `.tik` files in the `/files9/` folder that **do not** start with "00-"
9. Leave all the `.tik` files that do start with "00-" in the folder
  + If none start with "00-", then just continue.
10. Reinsert your SD card into your 3DS, then press (B)

##### Section III - ctrtransfer

8. Go to "SysNAND Options", then "CTRNAND Transfer", then "Auto CTRNAND Transfer"
9. Select the 9.2.0 ctrtransfer image when prompted by pressing (A)
10. **Backup SysNAND to `NANDmin.bin` when prompted by pressing (A)**
11. Allow the transfer process to proceed automatically, this may take some time
12. Once the transfer is complete, press Select to eject your SD card
13. Put your SD card in your computer, then copy `NANDmin.bin` and `NANDmin.bin.sha` from the `/files9/` folder on your SD card to a safe location; make backups in multiple locations; this backup will save you from a brick if anything goes wrong in the future **(Your backup should match one of the sizes on [this](nand-size) page; if it does not, you should delete it and make a new one!)**
14. Delete the 9.2.0 ctrtransfer image `.bin` and `.bin.sha` from the `/files9/` folder on your SD card
15. Reinsert your SD card into your 3DS
16. Press Start to reboot
17. Update your CFW SysNAND to the latest version using system settings
    + **Yes this is safe, stop opening Github issues about it.**
