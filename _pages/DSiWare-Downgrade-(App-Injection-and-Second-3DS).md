If you are between versions 11.0.0 and 11.2.0, you must follow this guide to downgrade your NATIVE_FIRM using DSiWare and a second 3DS which has already has a Custom Firmware installed on it in order to dump and restore your NAND.
{: .notice}

If you are below 11.2.0 on either device, then you should do the ctr-httpwn steps (when prompted) on each device under 11.2.0 to allow you to System Transfer with them.
{: .notice--info}

This takes advantage of an oversight which allows DSiWare titles to read and write anywhere in NAND.
{: .notice--info}

This is a currently working implementation of the "FIRM partitions known-plaintext" exploit detailed [here](https://www.3dbrew.org/wiki/3DS_System_Flaws).
{: .notice--info}

This guide will assume the CFW 3DS is running arm9loaderhax and was setup with this guide, but will work (with slight modifications such as doing all SysNAND steps on EmuNAND) on systems running an EmuNAND. Note that the terms EmuNAND and RedNAND refer to slightly different implementations of [the same concept](http://3dbrew.org/wiki/NAND_Redirection).
{: .notice--info}

You can skip everything related to **Steel Diver: Sub Wars** and steelhax if you already have a working primary entrypoint (e.g: OOT3dHax, FreakyHax) for **the target 3DS**, and use that instead.
{: .notice--info}

Your DSiWare's save will be backed up before getting replaced by the hacked save.
{: .notice--info}

{% capture notice-4 %}
This exploit requires you to [System Transfer](http://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/13996/) from a CFW 3DS to a stock 3DS as part of the steps. System Transfers will work in the following directions *only*:    
  + New 3DS -> New 3DS    
  + Old 3DS or 2DS -> Old 3DS or 2DS    
  + Old 3DS or 2DS -> New 3DS    
{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice--warning">{{ notice-4 | markdownify }}</div>

Both systems MUST be from the same region.
{: .notice--warning}

The source 3DS's NNID will be stuck on the target 3DS unless you either system transfer back or call Nintendo! (details in the instructions)
{: .notice--danger}

System Transfers can only be performed once a week.
{: .notice--danger}

#### What you need

* Two 3DS systems
  + **The source 3DS**: the 3DS running some kind of custom firmware (arm9loaderhax or some form of EmuNAND/RedNAND) *on the latest version*
  + **The target 3DS**: the 3DS on stock firmware *between 11.0.0 and 11.2.0*
* Purchase (or already own) and install a compatible DSiWare game from the eShop on **the source 3DS**
  + A pirated copy of the game will **not** work
  + For a list of compatible games, see the [DSiWare List](dsiware-list) page
* The sudokuhax injection `.zip` corresponding to your region

* Download a legitimate copy of **Steel Diver: Sub Wars** (the game is free, but any copy of the game not from the eShop will **not** work) on **the source 3DS**
* The previous release of [steelhax](https://vegaroxas.github.io/files/steelhax-installer.zip)
* If **the target 3DS** is below 11.2.0, you will _also_ need the following
  + The latest release of [ctr-httpwn](https://github.com/yellows8/ctr-httpwn/releases/latest)

#### Instructions

##### Section I - Prep Work

Use a [save manager](https://github.com/J-D-K/JKSM/releases/latest) to backup any saves you care about on the target 3DS (it will be formatted!)
{: .notice--warning}

1. Create a folder named `files9` on the root of **the source 3DS**'s SD card if it does not already exist
2. Copy `GodMode9.bin` from the GodMode9 `.zip` to the `/luma/payloads` folder on **the source 3DS**'s' SD card and rename `GodMode9.bin` in `/luma/payloads` to `up_GodMode9.bin`
3. Copy the `.app` from DSiWare injection `.zip` to the root of **the source 3DS**'s SD card
4. Copy `savedata` folder from DSiWare injection `.zip` to the root of **the source 3DS**'s SD card
4. Reinsert **the source 3DS**'s SD card
5. On **the source 3DS**, hold Start on boot to launch Hourglass9
6. Go to SysNAND Options, then SysNAND Backup/Restore, then backup **(min size)** SysNAND to `NANDmin.bin`
7. Press (Select) on the main menu to eject **the source 3DS**'s SD card, then put it in your computer
8. Copy `NANDmin.bin` and `NANDmin.bin.sha` from the `/files9/` folder on your SD card to a safe location
  + Make backups in multiple locations
  + This backup will save you from a brick if anything goes wrong in the future
  + **Your backup should match one of the sizes on [this](nand-size) page; if it does not, you should delete it and make a new one!**
9. Put **the target 3DS**'s SD card into your computer
10. **Backup every file on both 3DS's SD cards to two separate folders on your computer (keep track of which is which)!**
11. Reinsert each SD card back into their corresponding 3DS
12. Press (Start) to reboot

##### Section II - Backup DSiWare

After completing the entire guide, you can use this backup to restore your DSiWare saves by deleting the DSiWare from your System Memory and copying it from your SD Card.
{: .notice--info}

This backup can only be used on this NAND. If you format your 3DS or restore another NAND (specifically if `movable.sed` is ever modified), it will become unusable.
{: .notice--info}

1. Go to System Settings, then "Data Management", then "DSiWare" on **the source 3DS**
2. Copy any DSiWare games that are already on the SD Card back to the System Memory
3. Copy the DSiWare game you intend to use to the SD Card
4. Exit System Settings

##### Section III - Injecting the game and save

  + Keep in mind that exiting the System Settings will reboot the system
  + If the system is rebooted, you'll have to re-run ctr-httpwn before System Transfer will work

##### Section VI - System Transfer

1. **Backup every file on both 3DS's SD cards to two separate folders on your computer (keep track of which is which)!**
2. Reinsert each SD card back into their corresponding 3DS
4. If **the target 3DS** has a Nintendo Network ID on it, you must format the device using System Settings:
  + Go to the last page of "Other Settings" and select "Format System Memory", then follow all instructions
5. Read the following:
  + Your CFW 3DS = the source 3DS = "Source System"
  + Your Stock 3DS = the target 3DS = "Target System"
  + **Move DSiWare titles if prompted!**
  + Do **NOT** delete the source system's SD card contents if prompted
  + Make sure neither device's battery dies during the transfer
  + 2DS/Old 3DS (source) to New 3DS (target) only - if asked which method you wish to use to transfer the SD card data:
    + **Do NOT** choose the "Low-Capacity microSD Card Transfer" or minimal option (option 2), it will only transfer tickets and likely will not transfer the DSiWare save.
    + Fast Method: If you have the ability to move the data from the SD card (source) to the microSD card (target), when prompted use the "PC-Based Transfer" option (option 3).
    + Slowest Method: If you don't have the ability to move the data on a PC use the **full** "Wireless Transfer" option (option 1).
6. Go to [this link](http://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/227/) and follow Nintendo's official instructions for System Transferring from one system to another while keeping in mind what you just read

##### Section VII - Restoring the source 3DS

1. On **the source 3DS**, complete initial setup
2. Do one of the following

    + Call Nintendo and tell them you no longer have access to the device that your NNID is linked to (which is **the target 3DS** in this case), and would like it linked to a different device (which is **the source 3DS** in this case)
    + You can also just [remove the NNID](https://3ds.guide/troubleshooting#rm_nnid) from **the source 3DS** if you'd prefer it remain on **the target 3DS**
3. Reboot **the source 3DS** while holding Start to launch Hourglass9
4. Go to SysNAND Backup/Restore and restore SysNAND from `NANDmin.bin`

##### Section VIII - Backing up the target 3DS's NFIRM

  + If the game does not launch dgTool, [follow this troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting#ts_dsiware)
5. Select "Dump f0f1" to backup **the target 3DS**'s NFIRM
  + This will take a while
6. Make note of the NFIRM backup's location
7. Exit dgTool

8. Put your SD card in your computer, then copy `F0F1_N3DS.bin` or `F0F1_O3DS.bin` (depending on your device) to a safe location
  + Make backups in multiple locations
  + This backup will save you from a brick if anything goes wrong in the future

  + **FIRM version**: 2.50-11
  + If either of these do not display the versions above, something has gone wrong and you should try again from the beginning

You can use another entrypoint if you want to; steelhax is recommended because it is free.
{: .notice--info}

**The target 3DS**'s version number will *not* have changed in the settings.
