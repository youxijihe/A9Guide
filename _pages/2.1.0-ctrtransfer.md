此单元对于老3DS或2DS来说是必须的。如果你是New 3DS, 请看 [安装arm9loaderhax](installing-arm9loaderhax).
{: .notice--primary}

如果你将2ds降级到2.1.0并关闭无线连接，你可以拔掉电池等几秒然后重新装上开机，重新打开无线连接.
{: .notice--info}

装完ctrtransfer之后你的设备或许会不显示安装的游戏。This is due to the tickets being removed by the transfer, which is why you back them up. They will be restored at the end of the guide.

Never format a 2DS while on a version <6.0.0 or you will be unable to complete initial setup and will BRICK!

#### 步骤总览

In this section, we will be flashing your console's [CTRNAND](https://www.3dbrew.org/wiki/Flash_Filesystem#CTR_partition) partition to 2.1.0 in order to take advantage of an oversight in 2.1.0 for the purpose of extracting the [OTP](otp-info) unique to your console. This OTP file is required to install arm9loaderhax, and **cannot** be shared with other consoles.

This is accomplished by [installing a premade ctrtransfer image](https://www.reddit.com/r/3dshacks/comments/4zhe4a/) containing 2.1.0, copying your console specific files (such as `moveable.sed` and `SecureInfo_A`) to it, then fixing the title databases.

The OTP is a requirement to use arm9loaderhax on the Old 3DS, while the New 3DS uses an exploit in the way keys are encrypted on the device in order to install arm9loaderhax without the OTP.

#### What you need

* You will need to have booted into Decrypt9
* The 2.1.0 ctrtransfer image for your device and region
