title: "DSiWare 降级"
permalink: /dsiware-downgrade.html
---

**如果你是11.0.0或11.1.0,不要更新到11.2.0。新的更新将会推出，使DSiWare 降级NFIRM，_无需_使用另一台3DS或11.2.0以下的硬改.**
{: .notice--primary}

如果你是11.0.0到11.2.0的版本, 必需跟随向导，利用DSiWare和另一台3DS来dump和保存你的NAND以达到降级NFIRM的目的.
{: .notice}   

If you are below 11.2.0 on either device, then you should do the ctr-httpwn steps (when prompted) on each device under 11.2.0 to allow you to System Transfer with them.
{: .notice--info}

This takes advantage of an oversight which allows DSiWare titles to read and write anywhere in NAND.
{: .notice--info}

This is a currently working implementation of the "FIRM partitions known-plaintext" exploit detailed [here](https://www.3dbrew.org/wiki/3DS_System_Flaws).
{: .notice--info}

This guide will assume the CFW 3DS is running arm9loaderhax and was setup with this guide, but will work (with slight modifications such as doing all SysNAND steps on EmuNAND) on systems running an EmuNAND. Note that the terms EmuNAND and RedNAND refer to slightly different implementations of [the same concept](http://3dbrew.org/wiki/NAND_Redirection).
{: .notice--info}

{% capture notice-4 %}
This exploit requires you to [System Transfer](http://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/13996/) from a CFW 3DS to a stock 3DS as part of the steps. System Transfers will work in the following directions *only*:    
  + New 3DS -> New 3DS    
  + Old 3DS or 2DS -> Old 3DS or 2DS    
  + Old 3DS or 2DS -> New 3DS    
{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice--warning">{{ notice-4 | markdownify }}</div>

Both systems MUST be from the same region.
{: .notice--warning}

The source 3DS's NNID will be stuck on the target 3DS unless you either system transfer back or call Nintendo! (details in the instructions)
{: .notice--danger}

System Transfers can only be performed once a week.

  + Exit the System Settings
2. Launch **Steel Diver: Sub Wars**
  + Do not update the game
3. Press (A) to continue, then create / select a Mii
4. Exit the game
2. Launch the homebrew launcher on **the source 3DS**
  + If it is an arm9loaderhax installed device, you can do that with [hblauncher_loader](https://github.com/yellows8/hblauncher_loader/releases)
3. Launch steelhax installer
4. Press (A) to continue
5. Press (A) to confirm **Steel Diver: Sub Wars**'s version
6. Press (A) to confirm **the source 3DS**'s system version
7. Press (Start) to exit the installer
8. Press (Start) to open the homebrew launcher exit menu
7. Press (X) to Return to Home Menu (no reboot)
  + You may get an "Error has occurred" message with the option to continue. This is fine, just hit (A)
9. Launch **Steel Diver: Sub Wars** to test the exploit
  + Do not update the game
  + The save game may be corrupted
    + Do not press "ok" to delete the corrupted save data, just exit with the home button
      + If you do press "ok" by mistake, you will have to recreate the Mii
    + Redo the installation starting with the homebrew launcher
    + This can take many tries
  + If it is successful, the device will boot into the homebrew launcher
10. Once you are in the homebrew launcher successfully, launch steelhax installer
11. Press (A) to continue
12. Press (A) to confirm **Steel Diver: Sub Wars**'s version
16. This time, change the version to match **the target 3DS**'s system version
  + Even though you will be downgrading its NFIRM, you should still select the system version it is on now
12. Copy _the contents of_ the `starter.zip` to the root of **the target 3DS**'s SD card, then put the SD card back into **the target 3DS**

##### Section IV - ctr-httpwn

**This section is only required if _the target 3DS_ is under 11.2.0.**

**This will allow you to system transfer on versions other than the latest.**

1. Copy and merge the `3ds` folder from the ctr-httpwn zip to **the target 3DS**'s SD card
2. Reinsert your SD card into **the target 3DS**
2. Launch the homebrew launcher on the device using [Homebrew Launcher (No Browser)](homebrew-launcher-(no-browser).html)

3. Launch ctr-httpwn on **the target 3DS**
4. Press (A) to continue
5. Press (Start) to exit ctr-httpwn
6. Press (Start) to open the homebrew launcher exit menu
7. Press (X) to Return to Home Menu (no reboot)
  + You may get an "Error has occurred" message with the option to continue. This is fine, just hit (A)
8. Continue to the next section **without rebooting**
  + **the target 3DS** has been temporarily patched to allow network functions (such as System Transfer) without running the latest system version
  + Keep in mind that exiting the System Settings will reboot the system
  + If the system is rebooted, you'll have to re-run ctr-httpwn before System Transfer will work

##### Section V - System Transfer

1. **Backup every file on both 3DS's SD cards to two separate folders on your computer (keep track of which is which)!**
2. Reinsert each SD card back into their corresponding 3DS
4. If **the target 3DS** has a Nintendo Network ID on it, you must format the device using System Settings:
  + Go to the last page of "Other Settings" and select "Format System Memory", then follow all instructions
5. Read the following:
  + Your CFW 3DS = the source 3DS = "Source System"
  + Your Stock 3DS = the target 3DS = "Target System"
  + **Move DSiWare titles if prompted!**
  + Do **NOT** delete the source system's SD card contents if prompted
  + Make sure neither device's battery dies during the transfer

##### Section VI - Restoring the source 3DS

1. On **the source 3DS**, complete initial setup
2. Do one of the following *(or neither if you don't mind __the source 3DS__'s NNID being nonfunctional)*
    + Do the rest of the sections and then the full guide on **the target 3DS**, then wait one week, then System Transfer from **the target 3DS** back to **the source 3DS** *(remember you cannot transfer back from a New 3DS to an Old 3DS)*
    + Call Nintendo and tell them you no longer have access to the device that your NNID is linked to (which is **the target 3DS** in this case), and would like it linked to a different device (which is **the source 3DS** in this case)
3. Reboot **the source 3DS** while holding Start to launch Hourglass9
4. Go to SysNAND Backup/Restore and restore SysNAND from `NAND.bin`

##### Section VII - Backing up the target 3DS's NFIRM

8. Put your SD card in your computer, then copy `F0F1_N3DS.bin` or `F0F1_O3DS.bin` (depending on your device) to a safe location; make backups in multiple locations; this backup will save you from a brick if anything goes wrong

##### Section VIII - Flashing the target 3DS's NFIRM

**Do NOT downgrade with dgTool on a device that already has arm9loaderhax installed or you will BRICK!**

1. Launch your DSiWare game on **the target 3DS**
2. Launch dgTool using your DSiWare game

  + **FIRM version**: 2.50-11
  + If either of these do not display the versions above, something has gone wrong and you should try again from the beginning

Continue to [Homebrew Launcher (No Browser)](homebrew-launcher-(no-browser)), using steelhax for your entrypoint instead of one of the ones listed.
{: .notice--primary}

You can use another entrypoint if you want to, I just recommend steelhax because it is free.
{: .notice--info}

**the target 3DS**'s version number will *not* have changed in the settings.
{: .notice--info}

If, once transfered, steelhax only crashes to a black screen on **the target 3DS**, [follow this troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting#ts_steelhax).
{: .notice--warning}
