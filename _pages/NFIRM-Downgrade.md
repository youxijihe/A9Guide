**If you are on 11.0.0 or 11.1.0, do NOT update to 11.2.0. A new update will be coming soon that allows for DSiWare NFIRM Downgrading _without_ a second 3DS or hardmod for versions under 11.2.0.**
{: .notice--primary}

If you are between 11.0.0 and 11.2.0, you must follow this guide to downgrade your NFIRM using one of the methods at the bottom of this page to directly dump and restore your NAND.
{: .notice--info}

Both of these are working implementation of the "FIRM partitions known-plaintext" exploit detailed [here](https://www.3dbrew.org/wiki/3DS_System_Flaws).
{: .notice--info}

This will work on New 3DS, Old 3DS, and 2DS (although the DSiWare method has some restrictions).
